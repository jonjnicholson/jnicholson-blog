# Hi I'm Jonathan Nicholson 

I'm a software developer, photographer, and more. 

I'm the kind of person who's always excited to share whatever they're playing around with.

My current interests are photography, travel, technology, productivity, ergo keyboards, alternative keyboard layouts, and more!

Therein lies the purpose of this site--a place to share my interests with whoever is willing to enjoy them with me.
