I wanted to start off by sharing how I set up this site. I was impressed by how easy it was to do, especially since I'm new to both Hugo and Cloudflare Pages.

I followed the [excellent documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-hugo-site/) that Cloudflare provides. If you're not married to the idea of using Hugo, they also provide great documentation on [other frameworks](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/).

One thing I missed the first time I pushed updates to my repo was [setting the version of Hugo](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-hugo-site/#using-a-specific-hugo-version). The version that Hugo provides is older and didn't work with my chosen theme.
