Tailscale is a VPN service that makes the devices and applications you own accessible anywhere in the world, securely and effortlessly. It enables encrypted point-to-point connections using the open source WireGuard protocol, which means only devices on your private network can communicate with each other.\nIt has a very generous free tier that includes most of the features included in the higher paid tiers while limiting you to 100 devices\u0026ndash;more than enough for my use cases.\nWhere does it work? Tailscale also has apps and integrations with all the operating systems and devices that I require. I have it installed on my pi-hole and home assistant Raspberry Pi\u0026rsquo;s as well as my iPhone, Mac, and Synology NAS.\nAd blocking I have been casually using Tailscale, but I recently read this post that explained how to use Tailscale in coordination with your Pi-Hole to get ad-blocking even when I\u0026rsquo;m not at home.\nOne issue I ran into was covered by the troubleshooting section of the previously mentioned article, but the UI of my Pi-Hole running versions Pi-hole v5.17.1 FTL v5.23 Web Interface v5.20.1 did look a little different.\nUsing Tailscale while traveling Another aspect of Tailscale I recently learned is the concept of exit nodes.\nThe exit node feature lets you route all non-Tailscale internet traffic through a specific device on your network.\nThis means that I can use Tailscale in place of other VPN options to secure my internet traffic when I\u0026rsquo;m traveling and using public wifi.\nConclusion I\u0026rsquo;m very happy with how powerful Tailscale is as well as how great the documentation is. The free tier is extremely useful and I\u0026rsquo;m surprised that they offer all they do in the tier.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/how-i-use-tailscale/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"what-is-it\"\u003eWhat is it?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://tailscale.com/kb/1151/what-is-tailscale/#the-benefits\"\u003eTailscale\u003c/a\u003e is a VPN service that makes the devices and applications you own accessible anywhere in the world, securely and effortlessly.
